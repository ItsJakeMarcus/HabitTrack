My Dev Wars episode 1 submission

This is my submission for Dev Wars episode 1.

A Habit Tracker app using Swift Data and including 3 animations.

Animation 1: Adding to the score makes confetti fly. 
Animation 2: Taking away from the score fades the remove button slightly, a visual sigh. 
Animation 3: Navigating to the EditHabitView gracefully shows the UI coming into view onAppear.
